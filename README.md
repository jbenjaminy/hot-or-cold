# Hot and Cold
## Discription

The classic guessing game implimented using React and Redux. Here's how it works:
  1. The computer picks a number between 1 and 100.
  2. The user enters guesses until they find the hidden number.
  3. For each guess the user will be presented with feedback indicating how close their guess is from the hidden number.

## Installations

The code uses npm to manage dependencies. Make sure you have the latest version of node installed. 

1. Run `npm install` to set up the package
2. Since the package relies on webpack, you will also need to run `npm run build` before accessing the game
3. You will need to use a local server in order to access the game. Feel free to use your own local server or type  `npm run serve` at the command line. The package comes with [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) already set as a dev dependency. 
4. If you choose to use the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) via the `npm run serve` command, you can access the game at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
